# Snake-Classic
This is an implementation of the classic snake game in python and SDL2.
The game is written using Python 3, and uses the Pysdl2 module in order to add support for SDL2.
You may need to have SDL2.dll included with the snake.py file in order for it to run on windows, 
and SDL2.framework in your library path for usage on Mac
and you definitely need Python 3 installed.
